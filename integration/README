This is an initial state for the new robust cache inplementation, initially working only on OS-X. It includes source for integration tests and a make procedure.

It is intended that this "integration" directory is retained as a place for long-running integration tests, but the new cache modules (alloc, rwlock and cache)
are added to the agent source as and when needed.

The aim of the integration tets is to test performance agains prolonged bursts of activity, and to test that the cache is robust when client processes die.

On OS-X, with 2 or 3 instances of "cache" (the test excutable) with a garbage collection thread and a TTL expiry thread running, the cache can process about 3
million operations a second and is fairly robust in that it seems to repair itself when you kill of any of the cache executables.

This is currently a work in progress and in particular, we are working now on cache reformatting after certain errors taht can't be fixed up during the normal
running of the cache.

The makefile generates the following executables:

cache: this is a simlulation of cache clients that each make rapid updates in multiple threads to a shared cache. There are the following command additional
line options, which are needed to run the integration tests:

1) cache --destroy will reinitialise shared memory
2) cache --check will run a garbage collector thread, which kicks in every 2 secs.
3) cache --purge will run a TTL cache expiry thread, which kicks in every 3 secs to remove cache entries that have expired.

rwlock: which is a simple test of the rwlock module, in particular checking that writelocks are not starved when there are many concurrent readers.

alloc: tests the shared memory allocator in alloc.c. This can be run with native malloc in place of the memory allocator as a kind of benchmark comparison (the
shared memory one should be faster). This can also be run in multiple processes (though malloc can't compare with this). This test has the following command line
option:

1) --check, which will safely scan the memory structure once and print stats.
